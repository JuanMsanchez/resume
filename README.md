## About me
  > I'm a full stack web developer, focused on backend development with Node.js
  I'm experienced in building high availability and performance API's.
  As a devOps wannabe, I can work side by side with your infrastructure team to deliver
  solutions that are easy to deploy and scale.
  I love to work on projects where I can do research, analysis and once it's done
  focus on develop and deliver sustainable solutions for productive environments.

## Lately I've been working on...

##### Senda - [coinsenda.com](https://coinsenda.com)
> A BTC/FIAT trader application already on productive stage. On this project
I developed five different API's. An Oauth2 + JWT service, a Notifications service,
a Identity validation service, a Ledger service and a Crypto service to provide BTC transactions
and address generation.

##### Technologies involved:
 Node.js, Docker, MongoDB, Loopback framework, Bitcore and Insight API's

##### TheEye IOT - [theeye.io](https://theeye.io/)
> TheEye is an automation and monitoring tool for the devOps and sysAdmin teams.
Here I worked as a consultant to design the services ecosystem and integrations needed to
take TheEye to the physical world. I also worked with an electronic engineer to design
a multi purpose board to serve as a sensors and actuators communication platform.

##### Technologies involved:
  Node.js, Ardunio, ESP8266, C++, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, MQTT, Oauth2 and AWS

##### Frontec - [frontec.net](http://frontec.net/)

the main API and the Geoserver integration to provide the SPA and Mobile app with
all the data they need. Also I developed and administrative API and a series of batch
process to ingest the satellite and aerial imagery into the system.
